This wiki contains the design, architecture, implementation, and deployment plans for setting up a **Private Compute Cluster** using OpenStack, Ceph, KVM, QEMU, and SDNs. It is intended for managing and deploying virtualized environments with high availability, performance, and scalability.

The **Private Compute Cluster** setup provides a robust solution for managing and orchestrating virtual machines (VMs) and storage. It leverages **OpenStack** for orchestration, **Ceph** for scalable storage, **KVM/QEMU** for virtualization, and **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** for network management.

This wiki includes:
- Architectural designs and configurations for the setup.
- Step-by-step implementation instructions.
- A deployment plan for setting up and managing the entire cluster.

## Design Documentation

This section provides detailed design documentation, including a breakdown of the cluster components, their interactions, and the overall setup strategy. This documentation is essential for understanding the rationale behind the architecture choices and ensuring smooth deployment.

## Architecture Design

The architecture is based on the following components:
- **OpenStack** for cloud infrastructure management.
- **Ceph** for scalable and fault-tolerant storage solutions.
- **KVM/QEMU** for virtualization and managing VMs.
- **SDNs** for flexible and efficient network management.

The cluster is designed to be highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant, providing a flexible infrastructure for a wide range of use cases.

## Implementation

This section covers the steps required to implement the private compute cluster:
- Installation and configuration of **OpenStack**.
- Setup of **Ceph** storage for VM and data management.
- Deployment of **KVM/QEMU** for virtual machine management.
- Configuration of **SDN** for network isolation and performance optimization.

## Deployment Plan

The deployment plan provides detailed instructions for deploying each component in the cluster.

### OpenStack

- Detailed steps for installing and configuring OpenStack services.
- Networking and compute service configurations for optimal performance.

### Ceph

- Steps to install and configure Ceph for distributed storage.
- Best practices for Ceph cluster health and performance tuning.

### KVM/QEMU

- Configuration of KVM/QEMU hypervisors for VM hosting.
- Optimization techniques for maximum performance of virtual machines.

### SDNs

- Network configuration for software-defined networks (SDN) to manage cluster communication and ensure high availability and performance.

## Requirements

### Hardware

- **CPU**: Minimum 16-core processor with virtualization support enabled.
- **Disks**: At least 4 separate disks apart from the OS disk.
- **RAM**: Minimum 32 GB.
- **Storage Speed**: SSD with speeds of at least 1Gb/s or 10Gb/s.
- **Networking**: A switch supporting 1Gb/s or 10Gb/s speeds.
- **Motherboard**: Must support VT-d for direct device passthrough (e.g., GPUs, network cards).

### Software

- **OpenStack**: Supported versions for cloud management.
- **Ceph**: Version 17 for distributed storage.
- **KVM/QEMU**: For virtualization.
- **SDN tools**: For network management and isolation.

### Operating System

- **Ubuntu 22.04** or other compatible OS versions.
